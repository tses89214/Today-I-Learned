## Key Takeaways

This post is about some mindsets that the author want to remind all new-coming data engineer.

1. Find the values of your position
At first job, the author just do what he was assigned without think why and how have to do it,
As time passed by, he felt these tasks were not interesting as before. To Fix it, he tried to ask more tasks, but had less satisfaction and happiness.
Then he realized: Getting tasks done is not equal to creating values, he has to find the values as being a data engineer.
Finally, he found it in books, that says: A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, from getting data to serving data.
The first advice he wants to share with new-coming engineer is: find your responsibility, and value yourself with it.

2. Not every company has "Big Data"
we always learn from big tech company like Google, Netflix, etc., and expect that we can run a task on a huge spark cluster which may have 50 nodes,
but the fact is some companies don't need a Big Data System, maybe they only has few data need to be transfer and process. It varies in their fields.
The second advice is: No matter the size of datasets and companies, your responsibility is the same. Keep your direction.

3. Focus "fundamentals"
Building things are always fun and have a sense of accomplishments, but the author suggested digging more details about their fundamentals. 
With more fundamentals you know, you can resolve bug and incidents faster.
Furthermore, there are some shared fundamentals that are applied to different products. For example, separating storage and compute layers is a cool concept in SnowFlake, but it also used in BigQuery and Databricks.
There is a quick question you can ask yourself to check whether you get the fundamentals: Asking "What problems do this service/solutions solve?". The more you can answer, the quicker you can learn from this new services.

4. Be aware of the "Right Way"
You can store your code and do version controlling with GitHub. But technically speaking, you can also store it with Google Drive. (Just an example, don't do this.)
there are many ways to reach your goals, focus on the BEST one, not just random one solution that can work.

5.  Only technical skills won't get you far
In simple word, do not focus on how many skills you learned, focus on how many "problems" you solved. Learning skills will not make you get promoted, solving problems will.

This post outlines key mindsets for aspiring data engineers to help them navigate their career paths effectively.

1. Define the Value of Your Role
Early in his career, the author focused solely on completing assigned tasks without questioning their purpose. Over time, this led to burnout and a lack of fulfillment. He eventually realized that simply finishing tasks is not the same as creating value. By studying the data engineering lifecycle—from ingestion to serving—he learned that a data engineer's true worth lies in taking ownership of this entire process. The first piece of advice is: understand your core responsibilities and derive your professional value from them.

2. Recognize That Not Every Company Has "Big Data"
While we often draw inspiration from tech giants like Google or Netflix, many companies do not actually operate at that scale. In reality, data volume varies significantly across industries. However, your responsibility remains the same regardless of the dataset's size. The second advice is: stay focused on your mission as a data engineer, even if you aren't managing a massive 50-node Spark cluster.

3. Focus on Fundamentals
Building new tools provides a sense of accomplishment, but mastering the fundamentals is what allows you to resolve incidents and bugs efficiently. Many modern products share common architectural principles; for instance, the separation of storage and compute is a core concept in Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks alike. To test your understanding, ask yourself: "What specific problem does this solution solve?" The more clearly you can answer this, the faster you will master new technologies.

4. Seek the "Right Way," Not Just Any Way
While there are many ways to achieve a goal, technical debt often stems from choosing the easiest path rather than the best one. For example, while you could technically store code in Google Drive, GitHub is the industry standard for a reason. Focus on identifying and implementing the most robust and scalable solutions rather than settled for the first one that works.

5. Technical Skills Alone Won’t Take You Far
Success is measured by the problems you solve, not just the number of tools you know. Learning a new skill doesn't automatically lead to a promotion; solving high-impact business problems does. Shift your focus from "how many tools can I use" to "how much impact can I create."
