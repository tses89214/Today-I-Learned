## Key Takeaways

"DrP" is a root cause analysis platform created by Meta to automate investigation process when accident happened. It offers an SDK, and allows engineers to codify their investigation workflows (they call "analyzer"), and finally automatically apply action based on investigation results.

Today, it is in use by over 300 teams, run over 50000 analyses daily, and reduce MTTR (mean time to repair) 20~80%.

DrP is Meta’s automated root cause analysis (RCA) platform, designed to streamline incident investigation. By providing a dedicated SDK, DrP enables engineers to codify manual troubleshooting workflows into automated "analyzers." Once an incident is detected, the platform executes these workflows and can automatically trigger remedial actions based on the findings.

The platform has achieved significant scale and impact within Meta:

Currently adopted by over 300 engineering teams.

Executes more than 50,000 automated analyses daily.

Reduces Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) by 20% to 80% across various services.
